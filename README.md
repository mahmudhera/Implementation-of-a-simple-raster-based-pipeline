# Implementation of a simple raster based pipeline
This is an implementation of a simple Raster-based graphics pipeline. This is part of a class project.

# Scene description
The scene description is in the scene.txt file. The details of how the scene is oriented is in the Instructions.pdf file.

# What it does
The raster based pipeline scans the input scene and then generates intermediate scene representations after performing
a. modeling transformation
b. view transformation
c. projection transformation
d. scan conversion

After these stages are run, the program generates a bitmap image.

# Using image library
A sample code of how to use the bitmap image file is given in bitmap_sample.cpp
